Graph Library, JavaScript Implementation

### Three main hierarchical entities:
* **Link**, node elements, binds two nodes
* **Node**, graph elements, has collections of links
* **Graph**, has collections of nodes

### Each entity has its corresponding collection:
* **Links**, collection of links
* **Nodes**, collection of nodes
* **Graphs**, collection of graphs

### Entities and collections Hierarchical Type Order
Graphs->Graph->Nodes->Node->Links->Link

###Three main aspects, each one for each entity:
* **Direction**, Link aspect, split collection of links into to classes: **in** links and **out** links
* **Duality**, Node aspect, split collection of nodes into to classes: **hvert**(hyper-vertex) and **hedge**(hyper-edge) nodes
* **Multilevel**, Graph aspect, organize connected graphs into a multilevel hierarchical structure.
